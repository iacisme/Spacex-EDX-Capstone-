You are an expert at writing Data Science presentations.

I need to write an executive summary for my capstone project from EDX (IBM DS0720EN - Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project).

The Executive Summary needs to address the following two points:
* Summary of methodologies
* Summary of all results

For the "Summary of methodologies", the following methodologies were employed:
* ETL
	- Connecting and curating data from the SpaceX API
	- Web Scrapping Wikipedia's "List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches" web page
	- Data cleaning and wrangling using the Pandas Library in Python
* Descriptive Analytics
	- Creating and connecting to an SQLite database to perform EDA by using SQL queries
	- Perform EDA in Python by creating visuals using the Seaborn Library
	- Perform EDA in Python by exploring GIS data using the Folium Library
	- Create a Dashboard in Python using the Plotly-Dash library
* Predictive Analytics
	- Build and train classification models by using scikit-learn machine learning libraries
	- Selecting a model by evaluating model performance and comparing performance metrics of Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN models.

Here are some points for the "Summary of all results":
* This analysis covers SpaceX launches from June 4, 2010 to November 11, 2020
* The Falcon 9 Block 5 booster version is the only booster designed to be fully reusable
* The Block 5 booster first flew on May 11, 2018 (Flight # 54)
* Most successful landings occurred after Flight # 40 (August 24, 2017)
* Most of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket have been launched at CCAFS SLC-40, then KSC LC-39A, then VAFB SLC 4E
* The key drivers to selecting a launch site are desired orbit and manned vs unmanned rocket launches
* The best performing predictive model is a decision tree model, with an accuracy of score of 89%

Please write an executive summary based on these points.

This summary will be placed on a power point slide.
